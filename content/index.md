### Static doesnt mean boring
Static sites are far from boring because they offer a clean, efficient foundation that frees you to focus on creative design and interactivity. With tools like Eleventy, you can easily integrate dynamic features—such as animations, interactive elements, and API-driven content—ensuring that your site is both lightning-fast and richly engaging.


### Serverless
When people refer to "serverless" in the context of Eleventy websites, they mean that these sites don’t rely on a traditional, always-on server to dynamically generate pages. Instead, Eleventy pre-builds static HTML files that are served directly from a CDN or cloud storage, with any dynamic functionality handled by on-demand functions, resulting in faster performance and reduced infrastructure management.
